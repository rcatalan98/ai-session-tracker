## Codebase Patterns

- Pattern: Use `gh` CLI for GitHub API calls (already authenticated)
- Pattern: Parse Claude logs from `~/.claude/projects/{project-encoded}/{session-id}.jsonl`
- Pattern: Sessions have `gitBranch` field that links to PRs
- Gotcha: Branch names are in Claude logs, but issue links are in PRs (via "Closes #N")
