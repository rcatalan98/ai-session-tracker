## Codebase Patterns

- Pattern: Use `gh` CLI for GitHub API calls (already authenticated)
- Pattern: Parse Claude logs from `~/.claude/projects/{project-encoded}/{session-id}.jsonl`
- Pattern: Sessions have `gitBranch` field that links to PRs
- Gotcha: Branch names are in Claude logs, but issue links are in PRs (via "Closes #N")
- Pattern: Cache GitHub data in ~/.config/aist/repos/{owner}-{repo}.json

## 2026-01-13 - US-001: GitHub sync command
- Implemented `aist sync` command to fetch merged PRs from GitHub
- Files changed: src/github.rs (new), src/main.rs, src/bottlenecks.rs, src/metrics.rs, src/report.rs
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Use `gh pr list --json` to get structured PR data
  - Parse "Closes #N", "Fixes #N", "Resolves #N" patterns (case insensitive) to find linked issues
  - Store cache with owner, repo, PR list, and sync timestamp
  - RepoCache and PrMapping structs are ready for use by US-002/US-003
  - Added `#[allow(dead_code)]` for load_cache functions that will be used in later stories

## 2026-01-13 - US-002: Issue list command
- Implemented `aist issues` command to list GitHub issues with time metrics
- Files changed: src/issues.rs (new), src/main.rs
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Build branch→PR mapping from cache, then match sessions by gitBranch
  - IssueMetrics struct stores: issue_number, title, branch, total_minutes, session_count
  - list_issues() handles all display logic with colored output
  - calculate_issue_metrics() is reusable for US-003/US-004
  - Added tests for edge cases: no branch, no matching PR, PR with no issues

## 2026-01-13 - US-003: Issue detail command
- Implemented `aist issue <N>` command to show detailed metrics for a specific issue
- Files changed: src/issues.rs, src/main.rs
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Reuse flamegraph::extract_spans for activity breakdown across sessions
  - IssueSession struct links session reference with calculated duration
  - Use chrono::Local for user-friendly timestamp display
  - Activity breakdown uses HashMap<ActivityType, f64> to aggregate time
  - Colored bar visualization scales percentage/2 to keep it readable
  - format_timestamp() converts UTC to local time for display

## 2026-01-13 - US-004: Flamegraph by issue
- Implemented `aist flame --group-by issue` to generate SVG grouped by issue
- Files changed: src/flamegraph.rs, src/main.rs
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Reuse group_sessions_by_issue helper similar to issues.rs pattern
  - IssueGroup struct holds issue_number, title, sessions, total_mins
  - XML escape special characters (&, <, >) in issue titles for SVG
  - Same activity color scheme and proportional bars as generate_svg_by_project
  - Load GitHub cache at start, return clear error if not found
